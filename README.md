# CKEditor SDK #

This repository contains (future) CKEditor SDK that will include the [editor documentation](http://docs.ckeditor.com/) as well as samples.

It will be used for building online CKEditor SDK and you will also be able to download the whole package to use it offline.

**Note:** The development of the SDK has only just started, so it should not really be used by anyone yet. When the SDK is ready, it will be officially announced on the <http://ckeditor.com> website.
